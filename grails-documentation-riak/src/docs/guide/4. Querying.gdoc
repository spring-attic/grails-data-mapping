The Riak GORM module provides several ways to query data that is stored in Riak:

* [Dynamic Finders|https://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/5.%20Object%20Relational%20Mapping%20(GORM).html#5.4.1%20Dynamic%20Finders]
* [Criteria|https://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/5.%20Object%20Relational%20Mapping%20(GORM).html#5.4.2%20Criteria]
* [Named Queries|https://grails.org/doc/latest/ref/Domain%20Classes/namedQueries.html]

These queries operate in largely the same way as they do with GORM for Hibernate.
