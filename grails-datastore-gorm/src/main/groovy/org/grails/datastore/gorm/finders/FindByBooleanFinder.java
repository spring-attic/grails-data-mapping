/**
 * <p>The "find<booleanProperty>By*" static persistent method. This method allows querying for

 * properties. This method returns the first result of the query.</p>
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * eg.
 * Account.findActiveByHolder("Joe Blogs"); // Where class "Account" has a properties called "active" and "holder"
 * Account.findActiveByHolderAndBranch("Joe Blogs", "London"); // Where class "Account" has a properties called "active', "holder" and "branch"
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In both of those queries, the query will only select Account objects where active=true.
