It is possible to use Mongo's [Geospacial querying|https://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Geospatial+Indexing] capability by mapping a list or map property using the @geoIndex@ mapping:

{code}
class Hotel {
    String name
    List location

    static mapping = {
        location geoIndex:true
    }
}
{code}

By default the index creation assumes latitude/longitude and thus is configured for a -180..180 range. If you are indexing something else you can customise this with @indexAttributes@

{code}
class Hotel {
    String name
    List location

    static mapping = {
        location geoIndex:true, indexAttributes:[min:-500, max:500]
    }
}

{code}

You can then save Geo locations using a two dimensional list:

{code}
new Hotel(name:"Hilton", location:[50, 50]).save()
{code}

Alternatively you can use a map with keys representing latitude and longitude:

{code}
new Hotel(name:"Hilton", location:[lat: 40.739037, long: 73.992964]).save()
{code}

Once you have your data indexed you can use Mongo specific dynamic finders to find hotels near a given a location:

{code}
def h = Hotel.findByLocationNear([50, 60])
assert h.name == 'Hilton'
{code}

You can also find a location within a box (bound queries). Boxes are defined by specifying the lower-left and upper-right corners:

{code}
def box = [[40.73083, -73.99756], [40.741404,  -73.988135]]
def h = Hotel.findByLocationWithinBox(box)
{code}

You can also find a location within a circle. Circles are specified using a center and radius:

{code}
def center = [50, 50]
def radius = 10
def h = Hotel.findByLocationWithinCircle([center, radius])
{code}

If you plan on querying a location and some other value it is recommended to use a compound index:

{code}
class Hotel {
    String name
    List location
    int stars

    static mapping = {
        compoundIndex location:"2d", stars:1
    }
}
{code}

In the example above you an index is created for both the location and the number of stars a @Hotel@ has.
