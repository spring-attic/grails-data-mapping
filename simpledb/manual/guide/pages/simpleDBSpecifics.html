<h2 id="simpleDBSpecifics">1.2 SimpleDB Specifics</h2>
AWS SimpleDB imposes several critical restrictions.<p class="paragraph"/><h3>Eventual consistency model</h3><p class="paragraph"/>SimpleDB is based on the premise of eventual consistency model.
With eventual consistency, when you submit an update to SimpleDB, the database server handling your 
request will forward the update to the other database servers where that domain 
is replicated. The full update of all replicas does not happen before your update 
request returns. The replication continues in the background while other requests are handled. 
In other words, 
if you update an object and do a query right after 
updating it, you might get an old value back. There are ways to force strong consistency behavior but they go against the 
whole premise of choosing SimpleDB in the first place - SimpleDB is best used by applications able to deal with
eventual consistency and benefit from the ability to remain available in the midst of a failure. Future
versions of the plugin might add support for strong consistency though.<p class="paragraph"/>The best way to fight eventual consistency in the application is <strong class="bold">not</strong> to assume that the information is
available right after create/update/delete and store the objects you just modified or created in the cache. Generally,
information becomes visible within a couple of seconds, however it is a really bad idea to try to 
implement artificial delay in the application layer because when AWS experiences some problems the 
eventually consistency window might be 
drastically increased. Design for failure and you will get fewer surprises when they happen.<p class="paragraph"/><h3>Everything is a String</h3>
In AWS SimpleDB the only supported datatype is String, furthermore queries using LIKE keyword
string are compared in a  <em class="italic">case-sensitive</em>  approach.<p class="paragraph"/>The simpledb plugin automatically takes care of conversion to and from String for main data types. It must be noted
that proper implementation of the back-end of persistence layer must not only provide conversion to and from String
but provide conversion to and from String in format able to support comparison of resulting strings lexicographically (at least for
datatypes on which comparison is likely to be used).
Because everything is a string,
comparing naive toString representation of numbers will not work (89 is lexicographically greater than 321).<p class="paragraph"/>Current implementation provides sorting and lexicographical comparison -friendly persistence of 
the following data types (including negative values for numeric types):
<ul class="star">
<li>byte</li>
<li>short</li>
<li>int</li>
<li>long</li>
<li>Date</li>
</ul><p class="paragraph"/>The algorithm used to save numeric types is as follows (illustrated on the Byte example):
the goal is to move all negatives into the positives realms so that we can
compare strings lexicographically and it should be accurate for any mix of positives and negatives.<p class="paragraph"/>Byte is -128..127. Let's say if the value is negative we shift it by adding 128 and pad with zeroes into 4 digits.
This way we can cover all negatives and turn them into positives.
<ul class="star">
<li>-128 -&#62; 0000</li>
<li>-127 -&#62; 0001</li>
<li>. . .</li>
<li>-1   -&#62; 0127 (this is the maximum a Byte can hold)</li>
</ul><p class="paragraph"/>so now we need to take care of how to convert remaining range of 0..127 values.
Lets say that for those values which are initially positive we just do toString and prepend them with '1' and pad
with zeroes into 4 digits.
<ul class="star">
<li>0   -&#62; 1000</li>
<li>1   -&#62; 1001</li>
<li>. . .</li>
<li>126 -&#62; 1126</li>
<li>127 -&#62; 1127</li>
</ul><p class="paragraph"/>With this logic initially positive values when converted will be greater than 
converted negatives and yet conversion back/forth is faster than dealing with BigInteger (quick
note why BigIntegers are mentioned here. For byte, short, and int we can always step into 'next' storage bucket 
when shifting negatives into positives: for example if when dealing with bytes we say that result value is of type
<code>short</code> we can simply add the same 128 to <strong class="bold">all</strong> values byte values.
Unfortunately when we get to longs (which are used a lot, for example for versions), 
there is no 'next' bucket to hold sum of two longs, and the only choice would be to deal with BigIntegers,
which is very slow. Also, it would lead to inconsistent representation of numbers among all numerics - one algorithm
for <code>byte</code>/<code>short</code>/<code>int</code> and another for <code>long</code>)<p class="paragraph"/>A helpful side effect is that initially positive values when converted would look pretty much the same 
in the converted format (with leading 1), which is handy when looking at raw DB values.<p class="paragraph"/>(Decoding is simple - we look at the first char to decide how to proceed because we know exactly how we got it)<p class="paragraph"/>The short summary is that for this class<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>class Book  &#123;

<div class="code"><pre>Book.findAllByPagesGreaterThan(123)</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/> <em class="italic">In the current version, for numeric data types other than those listed above, dynamic finders with comparison will not produce correct results and should not be used.</em> <p class="paragraph"/><h3>Transactions</h3>
AWS SimpleDB doesn't support explicit transactional boundaries or isolation levels. There is no notion of 
a commit or a rollback. There is some implicit support for atomic writes, but it only applies within the 
scope of each individual item being written.<p class="paragraph"/>However, GORM for SimpleDB does batch up inserts 
and updates until the session is flushed. This makes it possible to support some rollback options. See more details
in 'Transactions' chapter
