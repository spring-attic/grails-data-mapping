A feature of Mongo is its ability to customize how important a database write is to the user. The Java client models this as a [WriteConcern|http://api.mongodb.org/java/current/com/mongodb/WriteConcern.html] and there are various options that indicate whether the client cares about server or network errors, or whether the data has been successfully written or not.

If you wish to customize the @WriteConcern@ for a domain class you can do so in the mapping block:

{code}
import com.mongodb.WriteConcern

class Person {
    String name
    static mapping = {
        writeConcern WriteConcern.FSYNC_SAFE
    }
}
{code}

{note}
For versioned entities, if a lower level of WriteConcern than WriteConcern.ACKNOWLEDGE is specified, WriteConcern.ACKNOWLEDGE will also be used for updates, to ensure that optimistic locking failures are reported.
