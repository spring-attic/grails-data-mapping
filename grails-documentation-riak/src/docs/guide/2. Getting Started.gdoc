To get started with GORM for Riak, you need to install the plugin into a Grails application:

{code}
grails install-plugin riak
{code}

Now you need to install and configure a Riak server for your architecture. To install Riak, you have several options:

* Use a pre-compiled binary downloaded from the official download page: [https://downloads.basho.com/riak/|http://downloads.basho.com/riak/]
* Install from a package manager like @apt@ or [Homebrew|https://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/]
* Install the source distribution

Once installed, you can run a Riak server in a terminal and gain access to an Erlang shell by doing the following (assuming Riak is installed to @/opt/riak-0.13.0@):

{code}
cd /opt/riak-0.13.0
bin/riak console
{code}

When run, you should see something like the following:

{code}
Exec: /opt/riak-0.13.0/erts-5.8.1/bin/erlexec -boot /opt/riak-0.13.0/releases/0.13.0/riak -embedded -config /opt/riak-0.13.0/etc/app.config -args_file /opt/riak-0.13.0/etc/vm.args -- console
Root: /opt/riak-0.13.0

{code}

The default port for Riak's REST interface is 8098. So the default URI built into the Riak GORM support will work. The default is @http://localhost:8098/riak/{bucket}/{key}@.

If you need to configure the URLs for the @RiakTemplate@, do so by adding configuration elements to @grails-app/conf/Config.groovy@:

{code}
grails.riak.defaultUri = "http://localhost:8098/riak/\{bucket\}/\{key\}"
grails.riak.mapReduceUri = "http://localhost:8098/mapred"
{code}
